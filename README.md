# Next 14 CRUD App

Create a web application using Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, 
and PocketBase as the backend! Taken and Inspired by Fireship's Next 13 Tutorial.

## Setup

1. Create a Next.js app using the npx command `npx create-next-app` and 
follow the instructions through the command line to set it up with TypeScript 
and TailwindCSS. Then `cd your-app-name`.

2. Download the PocketBase app from [here](https://pocketbase.io/docs/), unzip it, 
and import the executable to your project.

3. Start PocketBase with the `./pocketbase serve` command. Open the Admin UI, create 
some collections and update read/write access.

4. Develop your desired app!
